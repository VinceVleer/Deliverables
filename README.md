### Deliverables1

The HTML file is setup to represent the (HTML) layout of the given design "Deliverable-1.png".
Code is written to be easily readable, this is further made clear with the usage of the BEM coding convention.
Layout is complemented with the Flexbox technique to make the page responsive and prevent ugly scaling issues.
There have been no reoccurring issues during development.

### Feedback

Applied the semantic HTML 5 elements (with WAI-Aria) to the file, put text in the left and right columns and made the contact form an actual contact form.
