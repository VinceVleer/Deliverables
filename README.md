### Deliverables2

Setup the HTML file with no problems, written using BEM.

##Plain CSS

Writing the styling in plain CSS was pretty difficult. Positioning elements was an annoying task without the use of flexbox and/or CSS grid. Therefore I used alot of position, float & display rules.

##Flexbox

Transforming the plain CSS into flexbox was completed faster than I expected. It was mainly an issue of replacing the floats with flexbox to automatically allign certain items along their horizontal or vertical axis.

##CSS grid

I had not used CSS grid previously so I had to do some research before I started woring with it. Fortunately CSS grid is pretty easy to understand and use. I had some struggles getting it to work but once it did it was rather easy to apply CSS grid to the whole page.
