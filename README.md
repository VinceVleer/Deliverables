### Deliverables1

The HTML file is setup to represent the (HTML) layout of the given design "Deliverable-1.png".
Code is written to be easily readable, this is further made clear with the usage of the BEM coding convention.
Layout is complemented with the Flexbox technique to make the page responsive and prevent ugly scaling issues.
There have been no reoccurring issues during development.

### Deliverables2

Setup the HTML file with no problems, written using BEM.

##Plain CSS

Writing the styling in plain CSS was pretty difficult. Positioning elements was an annoying task without the use of flexbox and/or CSS grid. Therefore I used alot of position, float & display rules.

##Flexbox
